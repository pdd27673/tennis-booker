      "expansionPrompt": "Break down 'MongoDB Schema Implementation and Initial Data Seeding' into subtasks for: defining Go structs for all specified collections (Users, Venues, Bookings, ScrapingLogs) based on PRD 6.1, implementing MongoDB connection and collection/index creation logic, developing scripts/logic to seed initial venue data for LTA/Clubspark, and developing scripts/logic to seed initial venue data for courtsides.com/tennistowerhamlets.",
      "reasoning": "Schema definition for multiple entities, implementing DB connection utilities, and data seeding (potentially per provider) are distinct activities. PRD clarity reduces complexity but multiple entities and seeding logic warrant moderate score."

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down 'HashiCorp Vault Integration for Credential Management' into subtasks for: storing initial platform credentials in Vault as per PRD 5.5, developing a Go client/utility to read secrets from Vault, and developing a Python client/utility to read secrets from Vault.",
      "reasoning": "Requires integration with an external secrets manager and client implementation in two different languages. Storing secrets, Go client, and Python client are separable efforts."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down 'Python Scraper Development with Firecrawl MCP' into subtasks for: implementing scraper logic for LTA/Clubspark venues, implementing scraper logic for courtsides.com/tennistowerhamlets venues, ensuring scraped data is structured and stored into ScrapingLogs MongoDB, and implementing robust error handling and configurability for the scraper.",
      "reasoning": "Web scraping is inherently complex due to external website dependencies, JS rendering, and anti-bot measures. Firecrawl helps, but targeting different sites, data handling, and robustness are significant efforts."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down 'Go Scheduler Service and Redis Task Queue Integration' into subtasks for: developing the Go scheduler service to generate scraping tasks, implementing Redis integration in the Go scheduler for task publishing, and adapting the Python scraper to consume tasks from the Redis queue.",
      "reasoning": "Involves cron scheduling, message queue (Redis) setup and integration, and coordination between Go (producer) and Python (consumer) services. Each part (scheduler, Redis publishing, Python worker adaptation) is a distinct component."

      "reasoning": "Standard CRUD API development using Gin and MongoDB. Complexity is moderate, involving route definitions, handlers, DB interaction, and validation. Grouping by main preferences and venue preferences is logical."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down 'Intelligent Booking Engine (Initial Version with Playwright)' into subtasks covering: Go engine core logic (slot consumption, preference/credential fetching, matching), '7-day advance booking' timing logic, Playwright automation script development for LTA/Clubspark, Playwright automation script development for courtsides.com, and integration of Go engine with Playwright scripts including retry mechanisms and MongoDB updates for bookings.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to browser automation (Playwright), coordination between Go and Python, critical booking logic (timing, retries), and interaction with multiple services (Redis, Vault, MongoDB). Each platform's automation is a major sub-task."

      "reasoning": "Involves integrating two third-party APIs (SendGrid, Twilio), secure API key management, and implementing logic for different notification triggers. Each service integration and type of alert can be a subtask."

      "reasoning": "Extends existing API server with more CRUD operations and system endpoints. Complexity is moderate, similar to Task 6, focusing on different resources. Grouping by resource type (bookings, venues) and system endpoints is logical."

Initializing the Go project structure (PRD 5.1), Go module (`tennis-booking-bot`), and installing Go dependencies (PRD 5.2). 2. Initializing the Python project structure (PRD 5.1), Python virtual environment (`scraper-env`), and installing Python dependencies (PRD 5.3). 3. Setting up Docker Compose with MongoDB and Redis services, ensuring they are operational. 4. Setting up Docker Compose for HashiCorp Vault, including its operational initialization (docker part, `vault operator init`, `unseal`, basic auth) as per PRD 5.5. 5. Creating the `.env.example` file and performing initial verification of all components (Docker services start, Go build, Python env activation & dependencies, Vault accessibility and basic R/W test).",
      "reasoning": "The task involves multiple distinct setup areas: Go project initialization, Python project initialization, Docker Compose configuration for three services (MongoDB, Redis, Vault), and a multi-step Vault initialization process. Each of these requires specific configurations and verifications, contributing to a moderate-to-high complexity. Breaking it down allows focused effort on each component and simplifies verification."
