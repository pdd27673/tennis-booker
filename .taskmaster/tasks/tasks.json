The Vault Agent container is trying to write to a shared volume but doesn't have the correct permissions.\n\nSOLUTION APPROACH:\n\n1. Add proper user/group configuration to Vault Agent container.\n2. Use init container to set correct permissions on shared volume.\n3. Alternative: Use environment variable injection instead of file-based approach.\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n\n- Fix volume permissions in docker-compose.\n- Test file generation.\n- Verify backend service can read the generated files.\n</info added on 2025-06-13T12:21:24.751Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-13T12:31:48.358Z>\nAfter extensive troubleshooting with Docker volume permissions, switching to a more reliable approach:\n\nNEW STRATEGY: Environment Variable Injection\nInstead of file-based secret injection (which has complex permission issues), Vault Agent will be used to inject secrets directly as environment variables into the backend service.\n\nBENEFITS:\n- No file permission issues\n- Simpler configuration\n- More secure (secrets in memory, not on disk)\n- Standard Docker pattern\n\nIMPLEMENTATION PLAN:\n1. Create Vault Agent sidecar that fetches secrets\n2. Use docker-compose environment variable sharing\n3. Backend service reads from environment variables\n4.

The Docker volume permission issues have been resolved.\nRoot causes:\n1. Volume Mount Mismatch: Docker-compose was configured for `/shared` instead of the Vault image's default `/vault/secrets`.\n2. User Permission Issue: The Vault Agent process, running as the `vault` user, lacked write permissions to the directory owned by `root`.\n\nSolutions implemented:\n1. Volume paths were standardized to `/vault/secrets` across configurations.\n2. An init script now executes `chown vault:vault /vault/secrets` to set correct ownership.\n3. Shell quoting was added for environment variables to correctly handle values containing spaces, such as passwords.\n\nVerification confirmed all aspects are working:\n- Vault Agent authentication to the Vault server is successful.\n- All secrets are correctly retrieved from the KV v2 store.\n- Templates for `backend.env` and `backend-config.json` are rendered successfully.\n- Files are successfully written to the shared volume at `/vault/secrets`.\n- The backend service can read the generated files from the shared volume.\n- All secrets are properly injected with their correct values.\n\nGenerated files:\n- `/vault/secrets/backend.env` (containing environment variables with all secrets)\n- `/vault/secrets/backend-config.json` (JSON configuration with all secrets)\n\nThe Vault Agent integration using file-based secret injection is now production-ready.\n</info added on 2025-06-13T12:38:40.698Z>",

The established configuration priority is: 1. Environment variables (highest), 2. Environment-specific config files, 3. Default config file, 4.

Initialize the auth context/Zustand store with `isAuthenticated` (boolean), `accessToken` (string | null), `refreshToken` (string | null), and `user` (object | null). Update this state upon successful login and clear it on logout (logout function to be fully implemented in subtask 3).\n<info added on 2025-06-13T16:06:01.727Z>\nImplemented JWT token storage and basic authentication state management.\nKey implementations include:\n1. Token Storage Utility (`lib/tokenStorage.ts`): Created to manage JWTs, storing access tokens in memory and refresh tokens in `localStorage`. This utility provides methods for setting, getting, clearing, validating tokens (`setAccessToken()`, `getAccessToken()`, `setRefreshToken()`, `getRefreshToken()`, `clearAllTokens()`, `hasValidTokens()`), and initializing them from storage on app startup (`initializeFromStorage()`). Includes error handling for `localStorage` operations.\n2. Enhanced Zustand Store (`stores/appStore.ts`): The authentication state now includes `isAuthenticated` (boolean), `userProfile` (UserProfile | null), `accessToken` (string | null), and `refreshToken` (string | null). New actions `setAuthState()` (to set tokens and user profile on login/registration), `clearAuthState()` (to clear state and tokens on logout, integrated with `tokenStorage.clearAllTokens()`), and `updateTokens()` (for token refresh scenarios) were added. The store integrates with the `tokenStorage` utility for seamless token persistence and retrieval.\n3. Login/Registration Flow Integration: Both login and registration pages were updated to use the `setAuthState()` action upon successful authentication, ensuring proper token storage via the `tokenStorage` utility and updating the user profile in the Zustand store.\n4. Authentication Status Component (`components/AuthStatus.tsx`): A new component was developed to display real-time authentication status (e.g., authenticated/not authenticated), user profile information, and truncated access/refresh token values for security. It includes a logout button that triggers `clearAuthState()`.\n5. Security Measures Implemented:\n    - Access tokens are stored in memory, ensuring they are cleared on page refresh.\n    - Refresh tokens are persisted in `localStorage` to survive browser sessions.\n    - User profile data is held in the Zustand store and is not persisted to `localStorage`.\n    - Token values are truncated when displayed in UI components or logged to the console, enhancing security.\n</info added on 2025-06-13T16:06:01.727Z>",

Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login`, with their original attempted URL preserved as a `returnUrl` query parameter to facilitate redirection back after successful login.

Upon logout, preferences are reset to their default values for security. User preferences are maintained during token refresh processes.\nPersistence Strategy: User preferences are persisted in localStorage using Zustand's persist middleware. Authentication tokens are managed separately by a tokenStorage utility. Preferences persist across browser sessions but are reset upon logout.\n\nSettings Page Integration:\nForm Initialization: A useEffect hook initializes the form with data from the Zustand store when the component mounts. Array data from the store (e.g., preferredClubs) is converted to comma-separated strings for display in form inputs. The form also handles email fallback from the authentication context if needed.\nForm Submission Flow:\n1. Sets loading state to true (setPreferencesLoading(true)) and resets any existing errors.\n2. Transforms form data: converts comma-separated strings back to arrays and ensures correct numeric types.\n3. Simulates an API call with a 1-second delay (as a placeholder for future React Query integration).\n4. Updates the Zustand store with the new preferences using setUserPreferences.\n5. Provides user feedback (success/error) through the store's notification system.\n6. Resets the loading state to false (setPreferencesLoading(false)).\nError Handling: Errors are displayed using a visual error card if preferencesError is set in the store. The notification system is integrated for both success and error feedback, ensuring graceful fallbacks with user-friendly messages.\n\nData Flow Architecture:\nForm ↔ Store Synchronization:\n- Form to Store (on submit): Data from the form (e.g., preferredClubs as a comma-separated string) is processed (split into an array, trimmed, filtered) before updating the Zustand store.\n- Store to Form (on load): Data from the store (e.g., preferredClubs as an array) is formatted (joined into a comma-separated string) to populate the form fields.\nState Management Benefits: Achieved centralized state management for all preferences. Ensured type safety with TypeScript interfaces. Implemented automatic persistence to localStorage via Zustand middleware. Enabled form reactivity to changes in the store. Centralized error state management.\n\nUser Experience Enhancements:\nLoading States: The form's submit button displays a spinner and is disabled during save operations to prevent multiple submissions. Loading states are managed via the Zustand store.\nFeedback System: Users receive success notifications upon successful saves and error notifications on failures. A visual error card is displayed for persistent errors. Notification styling and behavior are consistent.\nForm Validation: Zod schema validation is maintained, providing real-time validation feedback. This includes validation for required fields and email format.\n</info added on 2025-06-13T18:17:12.205Z>",

Create a distinct component (e.g., `SystemStatusDisplay`) to clearly show the system's operational status (e.g., 'Running', 'Paused', 'Error', 'Idle'). Arrange these components in an accessible and intuitive section of the dashboard, possibly near the user preferences if on the same settings page.\n<info added on 2025-06-13T18:24:07.002Z>\nSubtask 11.3 implementation is complete. System Control Interface UI components were successfully implemented.\n\nKey implementation details:\n\nSystemStatusDisplay Component:\nCreated in /components/SystemStatusDisplay.tsx. It uses a SystemStatus TypeScript interface ('IDLE', 'RUNNING', 'PAUSED', 'ERROR') and accepts props: status, lastUpdate, and className. A status configuration system maps statuses to icons, labels, and descriptions (e.g., IDLE with Clock icon, RUNNING with Activity icon). Visual design features dynamic styling where background and icon colors change with status, badge integration with appropriate variants, animated indicators such as a pulsing green dot for RUNNING status, smart relative time display (e.g., Just now, 5m ago), and a responsive card-based layout with proper spacing and typography.\n\nSystem Control Section in Settings:\nThis new section features a header with a purple-themed Zap icon and \"System Control\" title and description. It integrates the SystemStatusDisplay component. Control buttons for pause, resume, and restart actions are arranged in a three-column responsive grid. System information, including monitoring statistics and performance metrics, is displayed in a two-column grid.\nControl Buttons were implemented using ShadCN Button components:\n- Pause Monitoring Button: Outline variant, with a Pause icon. Disabled when systemStatus is 'PAUSED'.\n- Resume Monitoring Button: Default variant, with a Play icon. Disabled when systemStatus is 'RUNNING'.\n- Restart System Button: Secondary variant, with a RotateCcw icon.\nInteractive features include smart disabling of buttons based on the current system status, hover scale transitions (hover:scale-105), consistent button heights (h-12) and icon spacing. Each action triggers an appropriate notification.\n\nSystem Information Dashboard:\nThis dashboard includes a Monitoring Statistics Panel (showing details like 'Monitoring 12 tennis clubs', 'Last scan: 2 minutes ago', 'Next scan: in 3 minutes') and a Performance Metrics Panel (showing 'Average response time: 1.2s', 'Success rate: 98.5%', 'Courts found today: 47'). The layout uses a responsive grid (1 column on mobile, 2 columns on desktop), a border-top separator from control buttons, consistent font weights and text colors, and clear section headers with bullet-point details for information hierarchy.\n\nTemporary State Management:\nLocal React state (useState) manages systemStatus (typed with the SystemStatus interface, e.g., initialized to 'RUNNING') and lastUpdate (e.g., initialized to 5 minutes ago). Control handlers like handlePauseScraping (sets status to 'PAUSED', triggers an info notification), handleResumeScraping (sets status to 'RUNNING', triggers a success notification), and handleRestartSystem (sets status to 'RUNNING', triggers a warning notification) are implemented. Notifications are color-coded (green for success, blue for info, yellow for warning) and provide clear, user-friendly messages.\n\nTypeScript Integration:\nType safety was ensured with an exported SystemStatus type (reused from SystemStatusDisplay.tsx), proper type-only imports for types, fully typed component props with optional parameters, and explicit SystemStatus typing for useState. Both the SystemStatus type and the SystemStatusDisplay function component (props: status, lastUpdate, className) are exported.\n\nUI/UX Enhancements:\nVisual consistency was maintained with a purple theme for system control (matching other sections), consistent card design (backdrop blur, shadow styling), use of Lucide React icons throughout (Zap, Activity, Pause, Play, etc.), and proper gap spacing in grids with consistent padding.\nAccessibility features include clear disabled states for buttons with visual feedback, appropriate text colors for light/dark themes, proper heading hierarchy and button semantics for semantic HTML, and descriptive button text and status descriptions for screen reader support.\nResponsive design follows a mobile-first approach, with single-column layouts on mobile devices. Tablet and desktop views use multi-column grids for optimal space usage. The button layout is responsive (1 column mobile, 3 columns desktop), and information panels also use a responsive grid (1 column mobile, 2 columns desktop).\n\nBuild Status: Successful (590.45 kB, +7.66 kB from system control components).\nComponent Integration: The SystemStatusDisplay component was created and successfully integrated.\nThe implementation is ready for the next subtask: Integrate System Control UI with Zustand Store.\n</info added on 2025-06-13T18:24:07.002Z>",

Control buttons (Pause, Resume, Restart) are connected to store actions and feature smart disabling logic based on current system state (e.g., systemStatus being 'PAUSED' or 'RUNNING') and loading status (isSystemControlLoading). Loading states are handled, and a combined error display for both preferences and system control errors is implemented. Real-time system information and performance metrics from systemControl.systemInfo are dynamically displayed, utilizing new time formatting utilities (formatTimeAgo, formatTimeUntil) for user-friendly date/time representation of 'Last Scan' and 'Next Scan'.\nSystem control state is persisted using localStorage, ensuring data restoration on app reload and reset to defaults on logout. State is synchronized across all components using the store, with automatic timestamp updates on state changes. Centralized error state management and visual error display are in place, with graceful fallback for null/undefined values.\nFull TypeScript integration with SystemStatus and SystemControlState interfaces ensures type safety for store actions, state access, and component integration, including proper null/undefined handling for Date types.

A `NewCourtHandlerWithDB()` function was added for production database integration. The implementation leveraged the existing `VenueRepository.ListActive()` method from the database package.\nEndpoint Implementation: The GET /api/venues endpoint now returns actual venue data from MongoDB.

HTTP method validation ensures POST/PUT/DELETE requests return 405. An integration test demonstrates the database repository pattern, and a mock repository was used for isolated testing.\nRouter Integration: `SetupRoutes()` was updated to accept a `VenueRepository` parameter and now uses `NewCourtHandlerWithDB()` for production database integration.

Sophisticated time range overlap logic was implemented using an `isTimeInRange()` helper. Comprehensive input validation for all filter parameters and proper error handling with descriptive HTTP 400 responses for invalid inputs were added.\nAdvanced filtering logic now includes application-level filtering for time ranges, provider, and price, alongside support for combined filters.\nComprehensive test coverage includes 14 test cases for various filter combinations, individual filters, combined filters, edge cases, input validation for all parameter formats, and error handling for invalid inputs, utilizing a mock repository with realistic filtering logic.\nProduction-ready features include a consistent JSON response format and backward compatibility, where requests with no filters maintain original behavior.\n</info added on 2025-06-13T23:53:45.050Z>",
